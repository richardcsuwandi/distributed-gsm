## Example
To see an example, please run the `dsca.m`/`dsca_multi.m` file for the Distributed SCA (DSCA) algorithms and the `d2sca.m`/`d2sca_multi.m` file for the Doubly Distributed SCA (D2SCA) algorithms.
To change the data set, simply uncomment one of the listed data sets and comment the others, e.g., for the `Electricity` data set,
```
% Read in data & some general setup
file_name = 'electricitydata';
% file_name = 'passengerdata';
% file_name = 'hoteldata';
% file_name = 'employmentdata';
% file_name = 'unemployment';
% file_name = 'clay';
% file_name = 'CO2';
% file_name = 'ECG_signal';  

disp(['Simulation on ',file_name]);
[xtrain, ytrain, xtest, ytest] = load_data(file_name);
nTrain = length(xtrain);
nTest = 20;
```
Other algorithm setups can also be changed in the corresponding files.

## Dependencies
The current version of the code uses MATLAB R2021a (https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) and MOSEK version 9.3 (https://docs.mosek.com/9.3/install/installation.html). Please refer to the corresponding websites for the installation instructions.
